# Semantic Analysis for YouTube User Comments
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze and classify YouTube user comments. The goal is to extract semantic insights from user-generated content to assist content creators and platforms in optimizing content strategies and improving user engagement.

## üìå Project Overview
Objective: Classify YouTube users based on their comments and uncover key discussion topics.

Impact: Provides actionable insights for audience segmentation and content optimization.

Tech Stack: Apache Spark (MLlib), Python, NLP tools (Word2Vec, TF-IDF, LDA)

## üîç Key Contributions
### 1. Text Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
RegexTokenizer used to clean and tokenize raw comment text.

TF-IDF and Word2Vec applied to capture semantic meaning and term importance.

Enabled extraction of meaningful features for downstream classification and clustering.

### 2. Classification Modeling
Built and fine-tuned Logistic Regression and Random Forest models in Apache Spark.

Classified users based on comment semantics for better audience understanding.

Models provided interpretability and performance suitable for large-scale data.

### 3. Topic Modeling
Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover key discussion themes.

Enabled identification of user interests and trending topics to inform platform recommendations and content creation.
